## Project description
'Brain Games' 🤯 — a set of five console games, built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions to which you have to give correct answers. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to go through it again. 

Here're the games:
1. Determining an even number.
2. Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be calculated.
3. Determining the greatest common divisor.
4. Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
5. Determining a prime number.

## Installation and usage
```
First.
Let's take a look at Makefile.

Second. 
Type in your REPL 'make install' — this command will install required packeges.

Third.
Then type the name of the game's name you'd like to run. For example: 'make brain-even' or 'make brain-calc' etc.

Enjoy!💛
```
